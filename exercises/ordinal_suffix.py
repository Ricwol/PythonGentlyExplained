"""Exercise #6: Ordinal Suffix

In English, ordinal numerals have suffixes such as the "th" in "30th"
or "nd" in "2nd". 

Write an `ordinalSuffix()` function with an integer parameter named 
`number` and returns a string of the number with its ordinal suffix.

For example, `ordinalSuffix(42)` should return the string `'42nd'`.

You may use Python's `str()` function to convert the integer argument to
a string. 

Python's `endswith()` string method could be useful for this exercise,
but to maintain the challenge in this exercise, don't use it as part of
your solution.
