"""Exercise #42: Bubble Sort

Write a `bubbleSort()` function with a list parameter named `numbers`.
The function rearranges the values in this list in-place. 
The function also returns the now-sorted list. 
There are many sorting algorithms, but this exercise asks you to
implement the bubble sort algorithm.

The objective of this exercise is to write a sorting algorithm,
so avoid using Python's `sort()` method or `sorted()` function as that
would defeat the purpose of the exercise.
