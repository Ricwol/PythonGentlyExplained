"""Exercise #31: Convert Integers To Strings

Write a `convertIntToStr()` function with an `integerNum` parameter.
This function operates similarly to the `str()` function in that it
returns a string form of the parameter. 

For example, `convertIntToStr(42)` should return the string `'42'`.
The function doesn't have to work for floating-point numbers with a
decimal point, but it should work for negative integer values.

Avoid using Python's `str()` function in your code, as that would do
the conversion for you and defeat the purpose of this exercise.
