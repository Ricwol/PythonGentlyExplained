"""Exercise #40: Merging Two Sorted Lists

Write a `mergeTwoLists()` function with two parameters `list1` and `list2`.
The lists of numbers passed for these parameters are already in sorted
order from smallest to largest number. The function returns a single
sorted list of all numbers from these two lists.

You could write this function in one line of code by using Python's
`sorted()` function:
    return `sorted(list1 + list2)`

But this would defeat the purpose of the exercise, so don't use the
`sorted()` function or `sort()` method as part of your solution.
