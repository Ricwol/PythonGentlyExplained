"""Exercise #8: Read Write File

You will write three functions for this exercise. 

First, write a `writeToFile()` function with two parameters for the
filename of the file and the text to write into the file. 

Second, write an `appendToFile()` function, which is identical to
`writeToFile()` except that the file opens in append mode instead of
write mode.

Finally, write a `readFromFile()` function with one parameter for the
filename to open. This function returns the full text contents of the
file as a string.

def writeToFile(filename: str, text: str) -> None:
    """Create file and write content to the file."""


def appendToFile(filename: str, text: str) -> None:
    """Append text to file if exist, otherwise create file first."""


def readFromFile(filename: str) -> str:
    """Return content of a file."""
    return ''
