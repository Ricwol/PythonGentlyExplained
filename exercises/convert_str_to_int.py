"""Exercise #32: Convert Strings To Integers

Write a `convertStrToInt()` function with a `stringNum` parameter.
This function returns an integer form of the parameter just like the
`int()` function. 

For example, `convertStrToInt('42')` should return the integer `42`.
The function doesn't have to work for floating-point numbers with a
decimal point, but it should work for negative number values.

Avoid using `int()` in your code, as that would do the conversion for
you and defeat the purpose of this exercise.
