"""Exercise #10: Find And Replace

Write a `findAndReplace()` function that has three parameters:

    - `text` is the string with text to be replaced
    - `oldText` is the text to be replaced
    - `newText` is the replacement text

Keep in mind that this function must be case-sensitive.
If you are replacing `'dog'` with `'fox'`, then the `'DOG'` in
`'MY DOG JONESY'` won't be replaced.

    Find and replace `oldText` with `newText` in `text` and return it.
